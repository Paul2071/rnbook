Aim of this project:

-Get understanding of how React Native works, specifically:
How to initialise app
How to style
How to test
How to Deploy

To get an idea of how these work, I will create a book review app that takes user input and displays it on the screen.

Log of coding:
using Android Studio, created virtual environment to get instant feedback on how app behaves
Looking at docs, very basic view and text tags added with lorem ipsum text and demo of how inheritence works with styling.
